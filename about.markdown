The RAMP project is currently contributed and co-funded by several people. The main active developers and project leaders, are listed below. 

- [Francesco Lombardi](https://flombardi.org) (TU Delft)
- [Pierre-françois Duc](https://reiner-lemoine-institut.de/pierre-francois-duc/) (Reiner Lemoine Institut)
- [Gregory Ireland](https://reiner-lemoine-institut.de/en/about-us/team/gregory-ireland/) (Reiner Lemoine Institut)
- [Mohammad Amin Tahavori](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadamintahavori?originalSubdomain=it) (VITO)
- [Francesco Davide Sanvito](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco-Sanvito) (TU Delft)
- [Sylvain Quoilin](http://www.squoilin.eu) (University of Liège)


Of course, RAMP has been contributed by many more people throught its evolution. Code contributors are acknowledged on [GitHub](https://github.com/RAMP-project). Other collaborators and scientific advisors who did not necessarily contribute to the Python code are featured in the peer-reviewed publications. You can get an overview of RAMP's history below.

<h style="color: ;"><b>Mid 2018.</b> There is no open-source software to simulate energy demand time series based on partial and uncertain data. We decide to address this gap in a small team of three institutions. The RAMP project is born.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Jun 2019.</b> RAMP is validated against real-world data, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.097">peer-reviewed</a> and released openly on GitHub.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Feb 2020.</b> RAMP starts walking on its own legs. Many institutions use it for their own studies.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Jul 2020.</b> As per the original plan, RAMP branches out to other energy carriers. Some of the original developers use it to simulate <a href="https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/e0c31c0f-a7b8-4599-e053-1705fe0aef77/ECOS2020-lombardi_quoilin_colombo-flexibility%20of%20smart%20p2h%20vpps.pdf">domestic hot water demand</a> time series in Italy</h></p> 
<br>

<br>
<h style="color: ;"><b>Feb 2021.</b> The multi-carrier vocation of the tool grows. RAMP is used to simulate cooking energy demand time series across Europe in the context of <a href="https://sentinel.energy/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/D4.2-EC.pdf">EU-funded projects</a>.</h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Oct 2021.</b> It is about time for an application to passenger mobility time series. The standalone <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP-mobility">RAMP-mobility application</a> to simulate mobility and charging time series of electric vehicles across Europe is made publicly available. </h></p>

<h style="color: ;"><b>Feb 2022.</b> The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118676">peer-reviewed publication of RAMP-mobility</a>, including its validation, is finally out. New institutions start using both RAMP and RAMP-mobility </h></p> 
<br>

<p><h style="color: ;"><b>Jun 2022.</b></h> TU Delft, the Reiner Lemoine Institut and the VITO Research Center join forces to co-fund the development of a 'next-gen' version of RAMP. More user-friendly and internally reliable, installable via pip as a single software 'engine' with different possible 'applications' (mobility, heat). Stay tuned! </p>
