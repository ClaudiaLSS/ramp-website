<p><img src="/assets/ramp_cloud.gif" width="400" align="right" class="pad-top-left"/></p>


RAMP was initially designed and is still mainly used to simulate electricity (and heat) demand profiles in remote areas at the community scale. This default version of the software is accessible <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP">here</a>.

<br><br>
We list below some representative case studies in this field.
<br><br>


<ul>
  <li>The simulation of the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.04.097">electrical load of the El Espino community</a>, which also validated the software engine.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The simulation of both <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/app10217445">electricity and domestic hot water</a> loads for the Chilean village of Toconao.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The customisation of the software to generate stochastic scenarios for how the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2020.07.002">load might evolve over the years</a>, accounting for uncertain parameters.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Mobility and charging profiles of electric vehicle fleets</b></p>

<p>The other main active field of application of the RAMP project is the generation of mobility and charging profiles of electric vehicles' fleets. The customised version of the software that makes this possible takes its own name of RAMP-mobility and is hosted on a <a href="https://github.com/RAMP-project/RAMP-mobility">repository of its own</a>.
<br><br>
In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.118676">recent publication</a>, we showed how RAMP-mobility can be used to generated such profiles for all European countries based on few, simple data, while accounting for environmental and socio-demographic differences.

<p><b>Demand profiles of energy for cooking and domestic hot water in residential buildings</b></p>

RAMP can be also customised to generate other types of energy-use profiles. For instance, it has been used to simulate <a href="https://sentinel.energy/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/D4.2-EC.pdf">cooking</a> or <a href="https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/e0c31c0f-a7b8-4599-e053-1705fe0aef77/ECOS2020-lombardi_quoilin_colombo-flexibility%20of%20smart%20p2h%20vpps.pdf">domestic hot water</a> energy consumption profiles for large user aggregates in European countries.

These two applications have been developed for the purpose of specific projects are currently not being further developed.
